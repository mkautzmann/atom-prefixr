atom-prefixr
============

Runs CSS through the ~~Prefixr~~ ExpressPrefixr API

This automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS and SCSS files. You can run
this plugin through `Selection > Run Prefixr`, `Edit > Run Prefixr` or pressing
<kbd>^âŒ˜X</kbd>.

**Prefixr.com is currently unavailable**: Because of that, this library is now
set to use [victorgama/express-prefixr](ExpressPrefixr), an open-source alternative.
If prefixr.com ever get stable again, this library *may* use its API.
